///
/// When `state.error` is a [GuardFailure], it is reported once, in every build mode, with
/// `FlutterError.reportError` (library `fespalier`, what the guard threw and its stack trace): a
/// widget test fails unless it calls `tester.takeException()`, and in a release build
/// `FlutterError.onError` hears it, which is where `SentryFlutter.init` listens. [guardError] builds
/// the view of the route at `state.uri` with a retry that runs the navigation again, only while the
/// router still shows this failure. Without a view, [notFound] shows. Any other error (no route matched, a
/// redirect loop, too many redirects) is [notFound]. It makes no `Future` and starts no timer.
///
/// The failure reaches the error route in one of two places. After `go`, a link or the first
/// location, it is the router's own error (`GoRouter.refresh` runs the navigation again). After
/// `push`, and `pushReplacement` and `replace` over other pages, go_router puts the failed list in an
/// entry on top of the stack and the router's own `error` stays null: the retry then closes that
/// entry with the same location and `extra` again, and keeps its page key (since 0.21.0). The `Future`
/// of the `push` that failed completes with the result of the page in its place when that page pops
/// (`null` when it is popped without one). A dialog, a sheet or
/// another route without a page over the error view is closed first, so the retry replaces the
/// error view and not the dialog. A retry held after the router moved on (the entry closed, another
/// page above it) does nothing.
