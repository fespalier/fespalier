# fespalier-downloads

> **Verified against fespalier `ca214107` (2026-10-09), release v0.14.0.**
> These skills ship in the fespalier repository, and CI checks them against its code
> on every change. Version-sensitive claims say the release they became true in; if
> your app pins another fespalier, trust that release's code over this page. See
> [Versions](https://github.com/fespalier/fespalier/blob/main/skills/README.md#versions).

**Since 0.15.0.** `package:fespalier_download` is the vocabulary of a download that outlives a screen: a request, a status
and the ports of a transfer engine. It adds no file kind, no `fespalier:` key and no `fsp` command, and `app.g.dart` is the
same bytes. It is pure Dart over `package:http`, with no platform plugin, and resolves on Flutter 3.32. A release that
predates 0.15.0 has no such package.

**Not built yet in this release: notification taps as routes, and a foreground upload.** The engine, `Downloads`, the
foreground `HttpDownloadBackend`, the `FileDownloadStore` registry, the providers, the background backend
(`fespalier_download_background`, Flutter 3.47, [`references/background.md`](references/background.md)) and background
uploads ([`references/uploads.md`](references/uploads.md)) exist (since 0.15.0); do not write tap routing or an upload over
an `http.Client`: they do not exist. A download that must go on while the app is closed uses the
background backend. What no device has answered about it (issue #158) is listed there as UNCHECKED: never state those as fact.

## The foreground backend

`HttpDownloadBackend(client: client, bases: bases)` (since 0.15.0) downloads with the app's `http.Client` while the app runs.
`bases` is a `Future<String> Function(DownloadBase)` the app writes (usually `path_provider`); give the engine
`TransferDownloadFiles(bases: bases)` so `remove`, `cancel` and sign-out delete the file and its `.part` and `.part.etag`.

- **Capabilities are `pause` only.** No background, no notifications, no user-initiated priority. A request with
  `DownloadNetwork.unmetered` is refused (`Failed(other)`), because the foreground cannot tell a metered network.
- **Resume is by bytes on disk**: the next attempt sends `Range` and `If-Range` from the `.part` and its validator; a
  server that ignores them restarts from byte 0; a part with no validator and no `sha256` restarts. After an app restart
  the engine reports `Failed(killed)`, and `retry` continues from the part.
- **A file at the destination is whole and checked** (size, then SHA-256 in another isolate, then an atomic move). A
  mismatch deletes the part. `cancel` deletes the part of a transfer in progress; an ended one keeps it for `retry`.
- **Failures**: `network`, `rejected` (other HTTP errors), `unauthorized` (401, 403), `sizeMismatch`, `hashMismatch`,
  `storage`, `unsupported`. On the web every start is `Failed(unsupported)` before a request: hand the browser the URL.
- **The client must honour `http.Abortable`** (the `package:http` clients do) or a pause cannot free a silent connection.
- `HttpTransfer` and `TransferFiles` are the pieces under it, exported for a backend of your own.

## The background backend

`BackgroundDownloaderBackend` (package `fespalier_download_background`, since 0.15.0, written against `background_downloader`
9.6.4) hands the transfer to the operating system: WorkManager and user-initiated jobs on Android, a background
`URLSession` on iOS. It needs Flutter 3.47, so it is not in the 3.32 floor job; an older app keeps `HttpDownloadBackend`.

- **Configure notifications or `userInitiated` is refused**: `BackgroundDownloaderBackend(notifications: DownloadNotifications(running: …))`.
  A `userInitiated` request without a `running` text is `Failed(notificationsRequired)`, because Android requires a visible
  notification for a user-initiated job. **The package never asks for the notification permission**; the app does.
- **`open()` the engine before the app calls `FileDownloader().start()` itself**, and never call the plugin's global
  `start`, `reset`, `configure` or `rescheduleKilledTasks` for these tasks. The backend registers callbacks for its own
  group `fespalier.download` before `resumeFromBackground` and never listens to the app's `updates` stream. The plugin's
  database is not the registry: a task the system lost is `Failed(killed)` and `retry` asks for a fresh grant.
- **A short-lived grant, not a header credential**: headers are in plaintext in the OS task queue until the task ends, and a
  retry sends the same ones (`BackgroundOptions(retries: 0)` where that matters). No refresh token, no DPoP.
- **Setup is the plugin's and the app's** (Kotlin 2.1, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `RUN_USER_INITIATED_JOBS` and the job service,
  iOS 14 and the notification delegate): "Android and iOS setup" in `docs/downloads.md`.
- **Test with `FakeBackgroundTransport`**; no test runs the plugin.

## Uploads

(Since 0.15.0, `fespalier_download_background`, over `background_downloader` 9.6.4; background only, the web is `Failed(unsupported)`.)
`Uploads(backend: BackgroundUploaderBackend(), store: FileUploadStore(bases: bases))` sends a file, a `DownloadLocation`
(base plus relative path), as multipart (`fileField`, string `fields`) or binary, `POST` or `PUT`. It is a **sibling of
`Downloads`**: no file port, so nothing it does deletes the file you sent, and an entry nobody mentions after a restart is
`Failed(killed)`, never `Complete`. Details: [`references/uploads.md`](references/uploads.md).

- **Replay safety is the rule.** Only an upload with an `Idempotency-Key` header (`HttpWrites.isWrite`, `replaySafe`) is
  retried by the platform, renewed after a 401 or 403, or sent again by `retry`. Any other is sent **once** (`retries: 0`, no
  pause in the plugin): a kill or a lost response ends it `Failed` with `outcomeUnknown(id)` true, and `retry` and `start`
  refuse it until the app `remove`s it on purpose. Never re-send a non-idempotent upload to unstick it.
- **Auth is a grant** (`Uploads(grantor:)`), headers in plaintext in the OS queue; its own plugin group `fespalier.upload`;
  telemetry in its own namespace, `fespalier.upload.*`, constants only.
- **UNCHECKED on a device**: the system sending an upload with the app closed, a server reading the plugin's multipart body,
  a non-2xx answer's status, how long an Android upload may run, WorkManager sending it again by itself, the two engines
  opening one after the other. Never state those as fact.

## Credentials

(Since 0.15.0.) Authenticate a download with a **short-lived capability grant**, not a stored credential: the app makes its
normal signed request in the foreground and the server answers with a single-file URL and/or headers that expire in minutes.
`Downloads(grantor: (request, {required renewal}) async => DownloadGrant(url: ..., headers: ...))` asks it before each start,
retry and resume (`renewal: false`; null sends the request as it is) and **once more after a 401 or 403** (`renewal: true`):
the engine cancels the failed attempt, keeps the bytes the backend can continue from, and enqueues again with the new grant.
A second 401 or 403, a grantor that throws, or a grant URL that is not a valid http(s) URL ends `Failed(unauthorized)`. A
cancel, remove, restart or `clearAccount()` while the grant request is in flight wins. The registry stores the request, never
the grant; `DownloadGrant.toString()` prints no field; the span end carries `fespalier.download.regranted: true` after a renewal.

- **`HttpDownloadBackend(credentials: HttpCredentials)`** (from `fespalier_http`; `fespalier_auth`'s `Authorizer` is one)
  authorizes each send of the foreground transfer with `authorize('GET', url)` and asks `retry` after a 4xx for one re-send, at
  most three sends, as `SessionClient` does; a credentials object that throws ends `Failed(unauthorized)`. It is foreground
  only. For anything an operating-system backend sends, use a grant.
- **Plain `DownloadRequest.headers` are persisted in plaintext** (the registry, and a background backend's queue). Never a
  refresh token or a long-lived bearer. DPoP per send cannot work in the background: the native callbacks cannot sign.
- A request that is not replay-safe (a `POST` or `PUT` without an `Idempotency-Key`) is sent once: no re-send after a 401,
  no pause cycling. `Uploads` is what sends one (see Uploads).

## In a widget

(Since 0.15.0.) Build one `Downloads(backend:, store: FileDownloadStore(bases: bases), files: TransferDownloadFiles(bases: bases))`
and override `downloadsEngine` with it in `startup.dart` (`downloadsEngine.overrideWithValue(engine)`). The provider has no
default: without the override it throws a `StateError` naming it. In a `ConsumerWidget`, `ref.watch(downloads)` (a
`Map<String, DownloadStatus>`; it opens the engine) and `ref.watch(downloadStatus(id))` (rebuilds only for that id; `Absent`
when unknown); act with `ref.read(downloadsEngine).start/pause/resume/retry/cancel/remove`. Disposing `downloads` clears the
engine's observer and closes it. Do not call `observe` yourself on an engine `downloads` watches: the slot is the provider's.

- **`FileDownloadStore` is the registry** (since 0.15.0): a JSON file `fespalier_downloads.json` in the `support` folder of
  your `DownloadBases`, written by atomic rename, never evicting (do not swap in a `BoundedDataStorage` or the `fespalier_storage`
  storages), empty when missing or corrupt, deleted by `clearAccount()`. In memory only on the web. Request **headers are in it
  in plaintext**, so a short-lived URL, not a header credential.
- **Test**: `downloadTestOverrides(backend: FakeDownloadBackend())` in a `ProviderContainer`; `backend.emit(id, status)` moves
  `downloads` and `downloadStatus`. Read a provider after an `emit` before asserting: Riverpod batches listener calls.

## Install

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml: the same url and the same ref as fespalier, or pub refuses to resolve
dependencies:
  fespalier:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/fespalier/fespalier
      path: packages/fespalier
      ref: <the tag of your fespalier>
  fespalier_download:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/fespalier/fespalier
      path: packages/fespalier_download
      ref: <the same tag>
```

(A fragment: pub resolves the pair only at a release tag that contains the package, 0.15.0 or later. Write `ref: v…` with
a real tag in an app, but never in these pages, where `cli/tests/versions.rs` would read it as fespalier's own version.)

`package:fespalier_download/fespalier_download.dart` also exports `FileDownloadStore`, `downloadsEngine`, `downloads`,
`DownloadsNotifier` and `downloadStatus`, and `DownloadGrant` and `DownloadGrantor` (since 0.15.0, see Credentials); `testing.dart` has `downloadTestOverrides`.

The background backend in detail, with its setup and what is unchecked, is [`references/background.md`](references/background.md); uploads (`Uploads`, `UploadRequest`, `BackgroundUploaderBackend`, `FileUploadStore`, `FespalierUploadConventions`, and the fakes `FakeUploadBackend`, `MemoryUploadStore`, `FakeUploadTransport`, all from `package:fespalier_download_background`) are [`references/uploads.md`](references/uploads.md).
The engine in detail, with the restart and sign-out rules, is [`references/engine.md`](references/engine.md). The model in detail, with the exact refusals of `isValid`, is [`references/model.md`](references/model.md). The fakes and a
test that plays a platform are [`references/fakes.md`](references/fakes.md).

## Golden rules

- **A file is a `DownloadBase` and a relative path, never an absolute path.** An iOS app's container path changes between
  launches, so a stored absolute path goes stale. The default base is `support`. A path that came from outside the app
  (a server's file name) goes through `DownloadLocation.isValid` first.
- **Check `isValid` before you start anything.** A request with a `file://` URL, credentials in the URL, a short digest or
  a `..` in its path is `invalidRequest`, not a download.
- **A request's `toString()` prints no field.** Do not add a `toString` of your own that does, and do not log
  `request.url`: the URL can be a capability.
- **No long-lived credential in `headers`.** A backend may keep them on disk in plaintext while a download is queued. The
  documented path is a short-lived capability: make the normal signed request in the foreground, get a short-lived URL back,
  and return it from the engine's `grantor` (see Credentials). Never a refresh token, never a long-lived bearer.
- **The registry is never a cache.** A `DownloadStore` keeps what the app asked for until `remove` or `clear` (sign-out);
  it must not be a `BoundedDataStorage`, which evicts.
- **Telemetry names are the contract**, `fespalier.download.transfer`, `.reconciled` and `.open`: add, never rename. Their
  values are constants, booleans and enum names, never a URL, an id, a path, a display name, a header or an error's text.
  If you add a span of your own, keep those out of it too.

- **`Downloads` imports no Riverpod and is yours to own** (since 0.15.0): `open()` it before `start`, give `observe` one
  owner, `close()` it when that owner goes, and call `clearAccount()` at sign-out.
- **`start` never throws for a bad request**: an invalid request or location is `Failed(invalidRequest)`, a
  `userInitiated` request with no notifications on the backend is `Failed(notificationsRequired)`. Neither is registered,
  so `retry` does nothing for them: fix the request and `start` again.

## Traps

- **`Failed(DownloadFailure)` carries a value, not a message.** There is no error text to show; map each failure to your
  own copy. `unauthorized` (401 or 403) is what remains after the engine's one renewed grant (or with no grantor).
- **A restart settles the registry once, at `open()`.** Give the engine a `DownloadFiles` unless the backend replays
  finished downloads: an entry nobody mentions is `Failed(killed)` without one.
- **`Running.total` is null when the server did not say**: do not divide by it without a check.
- **A switch over `DownloadStatus` is exhaustive** (it is sealed): a new case in a later release is a compile error in your
  `switch`, which is the point.
- **The web cannot download this way**: the foreground backend ends every start there as `Failed(DownloadFailure.unsupported)`;
  hand the browser the URL instead.
- **The package never asks for notification permission**, now or later. The app does.
