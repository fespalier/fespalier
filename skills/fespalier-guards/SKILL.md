description: "Guarding and redirecting routes in fespalier — guard.dart (a function over a Riverpod Ref that returns a location or null, for a folder and everything below it, in page-less groups too, and that runs again when what it watches changes), redirect.dart routes, the order guards run in, the uri parameter and returnTo for sending people back after sign-in, async guards, and auth patterns such as a session provider, a login page outside the guarded folder, and sign-out moving you to login. Since 0.9.0 also the fespalier_auth package: a session provider, restoreAuth in startup.dart, requireSignedIn, requireRole and redirectIfSignedIn guards, token storage, lazy single-flight refresh, an authenticated HTTP client (http and dio), OpenID Connect with PKCE and Keycloak, recipes for Firebase, Supabase and your own API, device-bound tokens (DPoP, fespalier_sign_keypair) and a fake backend for tests, and the fespalier_flags package for feature flags (flagGuard in a guard.dart, menus that follow a flag, a synchronous flag provider, vendor sources, FakeFlags). Since 0.13.0 also the fespalier_biometrics package: a biometric unlock guard that never prompts (requireUnlocked redirects to the app's unlock page), a single-flight unlock(), withBiometrics for actions, relock on resume, local_auth as a recipe (2.x and 3.x) and FakeBiometricPrompt. Load before adding a guard or redirect, wiring sign-in and sign-out, or when a guard loops, never runs, or shows not_found.dart at the login page."

## A guard

```dart
// (members)/guard.dart: guards /inbox, /admin and everything in the group
import 'package:fespalier/fespalier.dart';
import 'package:my_app/app.g.dart';
import 'package:my_app/auth.dart';

GuardResult guard(Ref ref, {required Uri uri}) =>
    ref.watch(session) ? null : LoginRoute(from: uri.toString()).location;
```

`GuardResult` is `FutureOr<String?>`: **a location to redirect to, or `null` to
let the navigation through**; it may be async, but return synchronously when you
can (any `Future`, even `Future.value(...)`, costs a frame and a blank first frame on a
cold deep link). A guard covers **every route at and
below its folder**, and the folder needs no `page.dart`: put the guard in a
`(group)` (or at the root) to cover a whole section.

- **Parameters.** First the `Ref ref` (positional; the older `ProviderContainer c` is
  still accepted), then **named**:
  `uri` (the requested location, query included), `extra`, the segments of its own
  folder and above (`{required String shop}`), and optional nullable query
  parameters. A guard **above** `$id` cannot ask for `id`.
- **Order.** Outermost first; **the first guard to return a location wins**; a
  folder's own guard runs after the ones above it, so an inner guard may assume what
  an outer one checked. The location a guard returns is navigated to and **its** guards
  run in turn.
- **No double runs.** Each page's `GoRoute` gets the `redirect`; nested pages go
  through their parent's, and shells get none (go_router runs a matched route's
  redirect for deep links and for navigation inside shells, tabs included).
- **It takes a `Ref`, not a `WidgetRef`** (a guard has no widget:
  ``a guard runs outside the widget tree: take `Ref` ``). **`ref.watch` a provider
  and the guard runs again when it changes** (since 0.5.0): if the new answer differs
  from the one the navigation used, the router runs the redirects again. Signing out
  on `/inbox` moves you to login by itself. See "Signing out moves you" below.
- **Stay sync when you can.** A guard that answers synchronously adds no frame and
  boots with no blank first frame; **any** `Future`, even a completed one, costs a
  frame. Return a `Future` only when you await something.
- A `guard.dart` with no route at or below its folder is a **warning**.
- **To redirect, use a guard, not an `onEnter`** (since 0.8.1): an `observe.dart` hook runs after the
  navigation committed and cannot veto it. See [`fespalier-observability`](../fespalier-observability/SKILL.md).
- **A guard is not access control**: the server must still authorise the data.

## Keep the login page outside the guard

A guard covers everything below it, so a `login/` folder inside the guarded group is
redirected to itself (`/login?from=/login?from=...`); go_router gives up at its
redirect limit and the router's error builder shows your `not_found.dart`:
**"Nothing at /login"**, location stuck where it was. Put `login/` **beside** the
guarded group, never inside it.

## Sending people back

```dart
LoginRoute(from: uri.toString()).location   // /login?from=%2Finbox%3Ffolder%3Dsent

// login/page.dart, when sign-in succeeds:
context.go(returnTo(from));                  // from if it is an absolute in-app path, else '/'
context.go(returnTo(from, fallback: '/home'));
```

`returnTo` lets only an **absolute in-app path** through; `https://...`, `//host`,
`/\host` and `javascript:` all fall back, so a crafted `?from=` cannot send people
off your app.

## `redirect.dart`

```dart
// old-inbox/redirect.dart: /old-inbox?folder=sent -> /inbox?folder=sent
import 'package:my_app/app.g.dart';

String redirect({String? folder}) => InboxRoute(folder: folder).location;
```

A folder has a `redirect.dart` **instead of** a `page.dart`. It takes a guard's
parameters (the first one, `Ref ref`, is optional since 0.5.0, as is the older
`ProviderContainer c`), inherits the guards above it, gets a typed route named after its
path (`OldInboxRoute`), and its target's guards run in turn. A tab layout's own folder
cannot hold one. It runs once per navigation and does not watch: a redirect route
never stays on screen.

## Two behaviours that surprise

- **An unparsable segment skips only the guards that read segments or query
  parameters.** `/vault/abc` (an `int id`) skips a `guard(..., {required int id})`
  and shows not-found, but a guard that asks for neither (for instance the
  `(members)` one above, which takes only `uri`) **still runs**, so `/items/abc`
  under it redirects to login first. (The 0.3.0 README said all guards are skipped.)
- **Signing out moves you, if the guard watches (since 0.5.0).** A guard that
  `ref.watch`es the session runs again when it changes, with `AppRoutes.router()` and
  with a router of your own built from `AppRoutes.mount()`, with no
  `refreshListenable`. Three limits: a guard **under a pushed page** does not react
  until you pop back to it (the push dropped its subscription, popping runs the guard
  again); a guard that takes `ProviderContainer c` (or only `ref.read`s) never runs
  again by itself, as on 0.4.1 and earlier, where **no** guard did; and a sign-out runs
  the guard **twice** (Riverpod recomputes it, then the router asks), without
  fetching the providers it watches twice. **Don't `ref.keepAlive()` in a guard**: it
  leaks a provider per navigation. A guard that throws never moves the router.
  Details and a compiled sample: [`references/auth-patterns.md`](references/auth-patterns.md).
- **DevTools shows each decision (since 0.7.0).** Its **Guards** tab lists every guard and
  `redirect.dart` that answered, with `pass`, `redirect` (and where to), `pending` or `error` for an
  async guard, or `skipped` when a segment did not parse; a redirect chain is one history entry.
  The generated `redirect:` wraps each call in `traceGuard`, which returns the guard's own result, so
  a sync guard stays sync (`fespalier-troubleshooting`, its DevTools page).

- **A menu runs your guards too (since 0.8.1).** `AppMenu.watch(ref)` (generated from `nav.dart`
  files) asks the guards that run for each guarded entry, with the entry's own location, to list,
  switch off or hide it. It follows a `Ref` guard's `ref.watch`es, shows an entry pending while an
  async guard is out, and reads a `ProviderContainer c` guard once. Keep guards cheap and free of
  side effects (`fespalier-layouts`, its page on menus and breadcrumbs).

## `fespalier_auth` (since 0.9.0)

fespalier's core has **no auth feature**; the `fespalier_auth` package (a git dependency next to fespalier, **same
`url`, same `ref`**) packages the pattern below: a session provider (`authSession`), `restoreAuth` for `startup()`,
token storage, **lazy single-flight refresh with no timer**, guard helpers and an HTTP client that attaches the
session to your API. It changes no generated code, adds no file kind, key or command.

```dart
// lib/app/(signed-in)/guard.dart: the group needs a session; sign-in/ sits BESIDE it
GuardResult guard(Ref ref, {required Uri uri}) =>
    requireSignedIn(ref, uri, signIn: (from) => SignInRoute(from: from));

// lib/app/sign-in/guard.dart: the trap. Without it, signing in changes the session and nothing moves
GuardResult guard(Ref ref, {String? from}) => redirectIfSignedIn(ref, from: from);

// lib/app/startup.dart
FutureOr<List<Override>> startup() => restoreAuth(authSetup());
```

- **`redirectIfSignedIn` is what sends the user back.** It watches the session, so signing in on the sign-in page
  navigates to `from` by itself; the page has no `context.go`. `returnTo` refuses `//host` and `https://…`.
- **No `refreshing` state.** A refresh keeps `SignedIn`; `isSignedIn` and `authUser` do not notify on a token
  swap, so no guard runs again. A refused refresh token is `SignedOut(reason: SignOutReason.expired)`; a network
  error keeps the session (`AuthUnavailable`).
- **Guards stay synchronous** once `startup()` returns `restoreAuth(...)` (no network, ever: an expired access
  token is refreshed by the first request). Without it the guards answer a `Future` while the session restores.
- **`authHttpClient` sends the session only to `AuthConfig.apiOrigins`**, refreshes once when the token has
  expired (shared by every request that finds it so: refresh-token rotation needs one refresh), and sends a
  request again after a 401, at most three sends. Watch `authUserId` in a `data.dart`: a user change reloads
  it, a refresh does not.
- **Tests:** `fakeAuth(signedInAs: ...)` from `package:fespalier_auth/testing.dart` is the `overrides` of
  `pumpRouter`; see [`fespalier-testing`](../fespalier-testing/SKILL.md).
- Never log or put a token, an id or an e-mail in an error or a telemetry attribute: the package's own
  `toString`s hide them.
- **With `fespalier_cratestack`** (since 0.10.0): `crateStackScope.overrideWith((ref) => ref.watch(authUserId))`, and a
  sign-out calls `ref.read(crateStackAccount).clear()` **before** `signOut()`, whose state flips synchronously (or
  `clear(scope: id)` after). A `401` keeps a queued intent's key ([`fespalier-offline`](../fespalier-offline/SKILL.md)).

- **OpenID Connect and Keycloak are in the package** (`package:fespalier_auth/oidc.dart`, `OidcBackend`: code flow
  with PKCE for a public client, Keycloak's endpoints and roles, refresh-token rotation). Firebase and Supabase
  are **recipes**, not packages. [`references/auth-backends.md`](references/auth-backends.md) has the code and
  what was read from a live Keycloak 26.8.0.
- **A replay after a 401 is marked** (`isAuthReplay(request)`, `options.extra[authReplayKey]`) and keeps an
  `AbortableRequest`'s abort trigger. **Never put `RetryClient` under the session client**: it re-sends the
  same DPoP proof and the server refuses it. Wrap `authHttpClient` in it instead.

- **Device-bound tokens are the `fespalier_sign_keypair` package** (a third git dependency with the **same `url` and
  `ref`**): `OidcBackend(proof: DpopProof.device())` signs every token call and API request with a key in the Secure
  Enclave or the AndroidKeyStore (DPoP, RFC 9449), and the server binds the tokens to it. **`DpopProof.device()` throws
  `DpopUnavailable` on the web, Windows and Linux** unless `fallback: DpopFallback.software` (a key in memory) or
  `DpopFallback.bearer` (no DPoP) is given. Sign-out deletes the key. Keycloak sends no nonce and no `Date`, so a wrong
  device clock is `DPoP proof is not active`: set the clock. [`references/auth-dpop.md`](references/auth-dpop.md).

[`references/auth-package.md`](references/auth-package.md) has the pieces, a compiled starter (a backend over
a JSON API, the guards, the sign-in form, an API call and its tests) and every behaviour above in detail;
`examples/auth` is the running version (guards, form, refresh, restore, Keycloak realm). Its messages are in
[`fespalier-troubleshooting`](../fespalier-troubleshooting/SKILL.md) (its `diagnostics-auth.md` page).

## Feature flags (`fespalier_flags`, since 0.9.0)

fespalier's core has **no flag feature**; the `fespalier_flags` package (a git dependency next to fespalier, **same `url`,
same `ref`**) is a guard with a source of values. It adds no dependency beyond fespalier, no timer and no polling, and
changes no generated code.

```dart
// lib/flags.dart
const labs = BoolFlag('labs');

// lib/app/labs/guard.dart: /labs is there while the flag is on; a nav.dart beside it is hidden while it is off
GuardResult guard(Ref ref) => flagGuard(ref, labs, orElse: const HomeRoute().location);

// lib/app/startup.dart
Future<List<Override>> startup() async => [
  flagSource.overrideWithValue(const ConstFlags({'labs': bool.fromEnvironment('LABS')})),
];
```

- **A flag is synchronous**: `ref.watch(flag(labs))` is a `bool`, never an `AsyncValue` or a `Future`, and a flag that is
  not known yet is its **fallback**. So the guard stays sync, the first frame is not blank, and menus (which run guards)
  hide the entry for free.
- **One `guard.dart` per folder**: compose with `??` (`flagGuard(...) ?? requireSignedIn(...)`).
- **Never call a vendor's async API in a guard** (PostHog's `isFeatureEnabled` is a `Future`: the entry turns pending and
  the first frame is blank). Put the value behind a `FlagSource`.
- **`follow: false` for a flow**: with the default, turning the flag off on the page takes the user off it.
- **A guard that redirected stays subscribed until the next navigation**, so a flag's subscription outlives the page it
  gated by one navigation (a test pins it). A guarded page under a pushed page reacts only when uncovered.
- **A cold deep link before the source is ready sees the fallback**: await the vendor's local load in `startup()`, or
  wrap a network-first vendor in `AsyncFlags` (the app's own `.timeout()` is the only timer).
- **Without an override every flag is its fallback.** A flag that is "always off" is no override in `startup()`, or a key
  typo (`FakeFlags.strict` in tests).
- **Not built:** a `route.dart` constant for a flag, vendor packages, a DevTools flag panel.

[`references/feature-flags.md`](references/feature-flags.md) has the package in full and a compiled starter (the route, the
guard, the menu entry, `startup()` and the tests); [`references/flag-sources.md`](references/flag-sources.md) has the vendor
bridges as compiled recipes (Firebase Remote Config, LaunchDarkly, PostHog, GrowthBook, an OpenFeature sketch). `examples/features` has `/labs` behind a flag. The tests use
`FakeFlags` from `package:fespalier_flags/testing.dart` ([`fespalier-testing`](../fespalier-testing/SKILL.md)); the run-time
messages are in [`fespalier-troubleshooting`](../fespalier-troubleshooting/SKILL.md) (its
`diagnostics-flags-storage-network.md` page).

## Biometric unlock (since 0.13.0)

`package:fespalier_biometrics` puts a route behind a fingerprint or a face. **A guard never prompts**: a guard runs again
whenever something it watches changes, and one that showed the platform's sheet would show it again each time.
`requireUnlocked(ref, uri, unlock: (from) => UnlockRoute(from: from), maxAge:)` reads the unlock state and redirects,
synchronously; the unlock page beside the guarded folder calls `ref.read(biometricUnlock.notifier).unlock(reason)`
(single-flight, never throws) and goes to `returnTo(from)`; `withBiometrics(ref, reason, action, maxAge:)` makes an
action ask again and throws `BiometricDeclined`. The app gives a `BiometricPrompt` in `startup()`
(`biometricPrompt.overrideWithValue(...)`); `local_auth` is a recipe, not a dependency, because its 2.x and 3.x cannot
share one source. The state relocks on a resume at least `BiometricPolicy.resumeGrace` after the unlock (default 10 s)
through core's `appResumeSignal`, with no timer and no listener; `maxAge` is checked at the next navigation or resume,
never by itself. Telemetry is `fespalier.biometrics.prompt` with `fespalier.biometrics.result`. Never call `unlock()`
from `build` or a guard; never put a guard on the unlock page.

[`references/biometrics.md`](references/biometrics.md) has the package in full and a compiled starter;
[`references/biometric-prompts.md`](references/biometric-prompts.md) (`local_auth` 3.x) and
[`references/biometric-prompts-local-auth-2.md`](references/biometric-prompts-local-auth-2.md) (2.x, with
`useErrorDialogs: false`) are the prompt recipes. The tests use `FakeBiometricPrompt` from
`package:fespalier_biometrics/testing.dart` ([`fespalier-testing`](../fespalier-testing/SKILL.md)).
