Two features, both **since 0.8.1** and both opt-in: **route lifecycle hooks** (`observe.dart`) and
**telemetry** (what fespalier reports to a `FespalierTelemetry` sink, and `fespalier_otel`, the sink that
makes OpenTelemetry spans). They share one watch on the router, so a page event means the same thing in
both. An app that uses neither generates the same `app.g.dart` as before and ships none of it.

## observe.dart

```dart
// products/$id/observe.dart: /products/:id and every page below it
import 'package:fespalier/fespalier.dart';
import 'package:my_app/analytics.dart';

void onEnter(Ref ref, {required int id}) => ref.read(analytics).view('product', id);
void onFocus({required int id}) {}
void onLeave(Ref ref, {required int id}) => ref.read(analytics).left('product', id);
```

Any of `onEnter`, `onFocus`, `onLeave` (at least one), each a public top-level function that **returns
`void`**. Parameters: an optional positional `Ref ref`, then named ones: the segments of its folder and
above, optional nullable query parameters, `Uri uri`, and `TypedLocation route` (bound **by its type**: it
must be called `route`); `onEnter` alone may also take `{required RouteScope scope}` (since 0.11.0, bound by its type, called
`scope`: `scope.hold(provider)` keeps a provider loaded while the page is on a navigator, `scope.onLeave(callback)` runs
when the page is gone). It applies to every **page** (`page.dart`) at and below its folder, in
page-less `(group)` folders too, `nest = false` pages included; a `redirect.dart` route never enters.
Order for one page: `onEnter` and `onFocus` run outermost folder first, `onLeave` innermost first.

Read [`references/lifecycle.md`](references/lifecycle.md) for when each fires (the rule that decides it,
tabs, pushes, redirects), the `Ref` a hook gets, the page's `RouteScope`, errors, and the traps.

## Telemetry

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
fespalier:
  telemetry: true # since 0.8.1; run `fsp gen` after
```

Then, in `main.dart`, **before the router is built**: `FespalierTelemetry.install(sink)`. With
`otel_zone`, the sink is `FespalierOtel(isReady: () => observability.isReady)` from `package:fespalier_otel`
(a git dependency next to fespalier, **same `url`, same `ref`**). Nothing is reported until a sink is
installed. Read [`references/telemetry.md`](references/telemetry.md) for the install and wiring,
`FespalierOtel.endpoint()`, **the web limitation of `OtelZone.runGuarded`**, go_router 17, and testing with
`RecordingTelemetry`.

Since 0.9.0, three more things, all in that page:

- **Several sinks.** `install` holds one sink. `FespalierTelemetry.combine([a, b])` is one sink that tells
  each of them everything, in order, each with **its own tokens** (a sink never sees another's) and
  isolated from the others' errors; `FespalierTelemetry.add(sink)` puts one next to the installed one.
- **`within`.** A sink may override `void within(Object? token, Object? Function() body)` to make a data
  or action span the current one while `data()` or the action runs (`FespalierOtel` does), so an HTTP
  client's spans are its children, after an `await` too. Call `body` once, synchronously; use **zone
  values only**, never `runZonedGuarded` or `onError:` (fespalier refuses that zone and says so once).
  An app made with `telemetry: true` calls `data()` through `traceDataCall(..., () => data(...))` for it.
- **`navigateFrom(NavigationSource.notification, () => router.go(...))`** marks the navigation it starts, and
  telemetry reports `fespalier.navigation.source` (`notification`, `shortcut`, `widget`, `link`). fespalier
  sets only `link` by itself, for a platform link (since 0.11.0).

Since 0.10.0 (`fespalier_tolgee`, `fespalier_cratestack`): **no new `TelemetryOp` and no new convention** (0.11.0 adds
`TelemetryOp.custom`, below), so an exhaustive sink still compiled on 0.10. A read through `ref.serve` and an action that calls `intentQueue.submit` run inside the existing
data and action spans. `fespalier_tolgee` has no telemetry in v1, and no sync span exists yet (it would be a custom op, `fespalier.cratestack.sync`: a new
`TelemetryOp` value breaks an exhaustive sink, as `custom` did; nothing from an intent, a row, a subject, a translation key or a server message would ever be sent).

Since 0.11.0: **`TelemetryOp.custom`** is a package's own operation, `FespalierTelemetry.begin` and `finish` with
`TelemetryStart(TelemetryOp.custom, name: 'fespalier.<pkg>.<op>', attributes: {...})` (see
[`references/telemetry.md`](references/telemetry.md)). A sink of your own with an exhaustive `switch` on `TelemetryOp` needs a
`custom` case. **`FespalierOtel` exports the name and the attributes verbatim**, so they must hold no user value (segment,
query, input, result, token) and the name must be a constant (`fespalier.push.open`, never `fespalier.push.order_42`).
`FespalierSentry` sends neither the attributes nor, by default, a failure as an event (a breadcrumb with the class only;
`capture:` opts in).

[`references/conventions.md`](references/conventions.md) is **contract version 1**: every span, event and
attribute name, for anyone building a dashboard or an alert. Adding is allowed within version 1; renaming
or removing is version 2.

## Sentry (since 0.9.0)

`package:fespalier_sentry` is the sink for Sentry, and it is **errors first**. By default it sends every error and
crash tagged with the route pattern, the app file and the action (`fespalier.route`, `.file`, `.operation`,
`.action`; fingerprint = default + the file), names the scope after the screen (its transaction and the tag
`fespalier.route`, so a crash caught by Sentry's own integrations says which screen it was on), makes **one
breadcrumb per page change**, and leaves release health to the SDK. **Next to `fespalier_otel`** in a
`FespalierTelemetry.combine`, each event carries `otel.trace_id` and `otel.span_id`, so an error links to its
trace. **No transaction is sent by default**: screen-load transactions, spans and TTID/TTFD are the opt-in,
`FespalierSentry(tracing: true)` plus `tracing: true` in `FespalierSentry.configure`, for a team that has only
Sentry.

```dart
FespalierTelemetry.install(FespalierSentry()); // in startup(), before the router; Sentry starts in zone()
```

Read [`references/sentry.md`](references/sentry.md) for the wiring (Sentry is the outermost zone: no
`OtelZone.runGuarded` next to it), the order rules, what is and is never sent, `tracing: true` (one transaction
per screen, the first screen on Android and iOS, no timer), the options, and testing with `RecordingSentry`.

## Analytics with consent (since 0.13.0)

`package:fespalier_analytics` reports each page the person opens to an analytics service by its **route pattern**
(`/products/:id`, never the URL), and **only while they have agreed**. It is a telemetry sink that an adapter installs
(`adapters: [fespalier_analytics]`), so the app needs **`telemetry: true`** (the adapter reports once when it is missing), and it sits
next to `fespalier_otel` or `fespalier_sentry` in the one `combine`. **No analytics SDK is a dependency**: you write an
`AnalyticsBackend` (`screenView`, `screenTime`, `consentChanged`), and Firebase Analytics, PostHog, Mixpanel and Amplitude are
compiled recipes. One call in `main()` before `AppMain.run()`: `FespalierAnalytics.configure(backend, screenName:)`; unconfigured, it
reports once and does nothing. **Undecided and denied drop every event on the spot: nothing is buffered, granting does not replay**,
and the stored answer is loaded in `startup()` (`FespalierAnalytics.sink?.consent = stored`) so the first screen is not lost.
Read [`references/analytics.md`](references/analytics.md) for the wiring, consent, `screenName` from `meta.dart` and testing, and
[`references/analytics-backends.md`](references/analytics-backends.md) for the four vendor recipes.

## The traps

- **Hooks fire after the frame.** `context.go('/x')` followed at once by an assertion sees nothing:
  `await tester.pump()` first. A hook never runs inside `build`.
- **A different segment value is a different page.** `/products/1` to `/products/2` is `onLeave` then
  `onEnter`, whatever `remount` says; a query change is no transition.
- **To redirect, use a guard.** A hook runs after the navigation committed; a `go` inside one works but
  is looked at one frame later. ([`fespalier-guards`](../fespalier-guards/SKILL.md).)
- **`ref.watch` in a hook watches nothing that lasts**: use `ref.read`. Changing another provider from a
  hook is fine.
- **A hook that throws is reported**, not swallowed: `FlutterError.reportError`, context
  `while running onEnter of products/$id/observe.dart`; the other hooks still run, and a widget test
  fails.
- **Telemetry on, no sink installed: nothing happens.** It is not an error. Install the sink before
  `AppRoutes.router()` runs, or the first navigation is not a span.
- **Analytics records nothing without `telemetry: true`** (since 0.13.0): page events reach a sink only from an app generated with
  it. **Nothing is sent until the person has agreed**, and what was dropped before is never sent later (no buffer, no replay).
- **A second `install` replaces the first** (since 0.9.0: use `FespalierTelemetry.add`, or `combine` both).
  An app that installs Sentry in one place and OpenTelemetry in another has only the last.
- **Sentry and `OtelZone.runGuarded` do not mix** (since 0.9.0). Sentry's `appRunner` is the outermost zone;
  `runGuarded`'s zone would send an uncaught async error to Talker only, and Sentry would never see it.
- **Two `ui.load` transactions per screen** (`tracing: true`): a plain `SentryNavigatorObserver()` makes its own.
  Use `FespalierSentry.navigatorObserver()`.
- **Nothing in Sentry**: an empty `SENTRY_DSN` (the SDK and the sink are off), no `install`, no `telemetry: true`,
  or, for transactions, no `tracing: true` in **both** places or a release sample rate of 0.1.
- **A sink's `within` must not give its zone an error handler** (since 0.9.0). `runZonedGuarded` there
  would strand a failing `data()` on its loading view, so fespalier runs the call outside that zone and
  prints `fespalier telemetry: <Sink>.within changed the error zone ...` once. Use `runZoned(body,
zoneValues: {...})`.
- **`fespalier` and `fespalier_otel` must be the same git dependency** (same `url`, same `ref`), or pub
  refuses to resolve; see [fespalier-troubleshooting](../fespalier-troubleshooting/SKILL.md) (its observe.dart and telemetry page).
- **`otel_zone` forces go_router 17** in an app that uses it (`otel_go_router` caps it); fespalier accepts
  17 and 18.
- **`OtelZone.runGuarded` leaves a Flutter web app blank.** Run the body as it is on the web
  (`kIsWeb ? body() : observability.runGuarded(body)`). Since 0.8.1, known limitation.

## Where the code is

- Hooks: `packages/fespalier/lib/src/lifecycle.dart` (the router watch, `RouteHooks`, `observeAttach`);
  `route_scope.dart` (`RouteScope`, `pageInstanceId`);
  the generator reads `observe.dart` in `cli/src/resolve.rs` and writes `RouteMatcher.observe`,
  `_observeAt` and `AppRoutes.attach` into `app.g.dart`.
- Telemetry: `packages/fespalier/lib/src/telemetry.dart` (the sink API, `combine`, `within`,
  `NavigationSource` and `navigateFrom`, and what the generated call sites reach; `traceDataCall` is in
  `devtools/devtools.dart`), `navigation_kind.dart` (the `initial`/`go`/`push`/`pop`/`replace`/`refresh` classifier DevTools
  shares) and `version.dart`; the adapters are `packages/fespalier_otel/` and, since 0.9.0, `packages/fespalier_sentry/`
  (`traceOf` and `linkTrace` in `telemetry.dart` are how the two share a trace).
- Analytics (since 0.13.0): `packages/fespalier_analytics/` (`lib/src/sink.dart` the sink and `FespalierAnalytics`, `lib/fespalier_adapter.dart`, `lib/testing.dart`).
- Scaffold: `fsp new 'orders/[id]' --observe` writes `observe.dart`.
- The example is `examples/telemetry`: lifecycle tests and span tests, on go_router 17.
